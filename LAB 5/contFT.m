function [X,f,df] = contFT(x,tstart,dt,df_desired)
%Use Matlab DFT for approximate computation of continuous time Fourier %transform
%INPUTS
%x = vector of time domain samples, assumed uniformly spaced
%tstart= time at which first sample is taken
%dt = spacing between samples
%df_desired = desired frequency resolution

%OUTPUTS
%X=vector of samples of Fourier transform
%f=corresponding vector of frequencies at which samples are obtained %df=freq resolution attained (redundant--already available from %difference of consecutive entries of f)

%%%%%%%%%
%minimum FFT size determined by desired freq 
Nmin=max(ceil(1/(df_desired*dt)),length(x));
%choose FFT size to be the next power of 2
Nfft = 2^(nextpow2(Nmin));
%compute Fourier transform, centering around 
X=dt*fftshift(fft(x,Nfft));
%achieved frequency resolution
df=1/(Nfft*dt);
%range of frequencies covered
f = ((0:Nfft-1)-Nfft/2)*df; %same as f=-1/(2*dt):df:1/(2*dt) - df

%phase shift associated with start time 
X=X.*exp(-j*2*pi*f*tstart);
