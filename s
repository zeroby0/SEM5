“Oft expectation fails, and most oft there where most it promises.”

- William Shakespeare

In layman’s English, Expectation is the root of all heartbreak.

~~~~~

Even after all this time

The Sun never says to the Earth.

“You owe me.”

Look what happens with a love like that ,

It lights up the whole goddamn sky .

Expectations from anyone, anything and even yourself will break you. The best thing is to give your best and let go.

The moment you start expecting results and get a grade lesser than your expectations you feel dejected.

The biggest mistake we do when we fall in love is that we start expecting. The moment you expect you bf or gf to do things you want and they don’t,you will feel bad. It’s best if you do what you have to for someone without expecting anything(it’s tough I know). So,it is very important that sacrificing small things and going out of your way for someone else makes both of you happy. Their smile should be worth it. :)

It is not good to expect too much from yourself. It’s wrong to expect yourself to work sleeplessly before your exams when you don’t even like what you are studying.

The only people you can expect anything from are your parents because even your other half will at least expect you to love them back.

So, let go of expectations. Do what makes you happy . :D

Cheers !
